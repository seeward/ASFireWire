//
// This is the first half of the vendor driver's blank-slate configuration.
// Linux calls it the very first thing in discovery and treats failure as fatal,
// under the comment "initialize these parameters because driver is not allowed

// (bebob_maudio.c:273-281). Without it the device is never told to clock
// internally, and a device that is not clocked does not transmit — which is
// exactly what a silent IR context looks like.
//
// Closed by construction, like BeBoBBootloaderCue and AVCSignalFormatProbe: the
// company ID has no parameter. That is the whole safety boundary here. BridgeCo's
// own extensions are also vendor-dependent, also opcode 0x00, and freeze this
// firmware; only bytes 3..5 separate this command from the ones that hang it.
