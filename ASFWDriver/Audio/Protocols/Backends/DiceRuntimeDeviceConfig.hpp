    // things used to be derived from it and both were wrong:

    //   * `sampleRates.assign(1, ...)` collapsed the advertised list to that one
    //     rate. Since AudioNubPublisher::EnsureNub is create-once, whichever
    //     value reached the first publish became permanent, and every other rate
    //     was then refused by ASFWAudioDevice's rate validation. Whether that
    //     happened at all depended on a race with EnsureRuntimeStreamGeometry,
    //     so the same code produced a switchable device or a locked one
    //     depending on how quickly caps loaded.
    //
    //   * adopting it as `currentSampleRate` disagreed with bring-up, which
    //     programs 48 kHz internal (DICEDuplexBringupController). A device found
    //     at 44.1 kHz was published to CoreAudio as 44.1 kHz and then driven at
    //     48 kHz.
    //
    // The caller seeds both fields before this runs: the profile's supported
    // rate set, and 48 kHz as the DICE default that bring-up will actually
    // program. Leave them alone. Rate changes go through the HAL path
    // (HandleChangeSampleRate -> RequestSampleRateChange), which reprograms
    // CLOCK_SELECT and is the only place the device's clock should move.
