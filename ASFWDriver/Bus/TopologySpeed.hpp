/**
 * @brief Highest speed usable between two nodes, from Self-ID evidence alone.
 *
 * Walks the Self-ID link graph and takes the minimum PHY speed along the path,
 * which is the speed a packet between the two nodes must be sent at
 * (IEEE 1394-2008 §4.2.3: a repeating PHY cannot resend faster than it
 * received). Returns nullopt when the topology is not valid or the nodes are
 * not connected, so callers decide their own conservative fallback rather than
 * silently receiving S100.
 *
 * This is deliberately the *only* speed source appropriate for isochronous
 * traffic. Apple resolves isoch speed from the PHY
 * (IOFWIsochChannel.cpp:653 — `fControl->getLink()->getPhySpeed()`), and keeps
 * its per-node-pair `fSpeedVector` — which async transmit reads at
 * IOFireWireController.cpp:7058, and which `setNodeSpeed(..., FWSpeed(...) - 1)`
 * demotes when a scan fails (:2755-2759) — out of the isoch path entirely. A
 * device that mishandles async requests at S400 has told us nothing about what
 * its isochronous receiver can do.
 *
 * @note Uncapped by design. SpeedMapService clamps to S400 because the legacy
 *       SPEED_MAP CSR image is a conservative diagnostic surface; a transmit
 *       speed decision must not inherit that clamp.
