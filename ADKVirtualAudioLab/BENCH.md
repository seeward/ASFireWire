# ADKVirtualAudioLab — Milestone 3 bench runbook

How to load the lab dext, drive it with real HAL pacing, and read back the
verifier + O/C instrumentation. The dext code answers the README's O1–O3 and
C1–C4 questions with counters; this file is the procedure around it.

## What the M3 build does

- `VirtualAudioDevice` is its own clock master: an `IOTimerDispatchSource`
  fires once per ZTS period (512 frames ≈ 10.667 ms) on the mach-absolute
  timebase, anchors `UpdateCurrentZeroTimestamp(n*512, fire_time)` with raw
  values (nominal deadline chain, actual fire times — the host smooths), and
  exposes the next period's packets (the stand-in for an IT-ring interrupt).
- The Step 6 `Verifying(Fake)` decorator runs for the whole IO session.
- `StopIO` dumps everything via `IOLog` with the `ADKLab[dump]` prefix.
- Output ring = 8 ZTS periods (4096 frames). Transport type reports FireWire.
- Four stable CoreAudio devices are published for configuration experiments:
  Duet, PHASE 88, FireWire 1814, and Saffire Pro 24 DSP. Their current
  transport/packet rig is still the Saffire-shaped playback fixture; the
  configuration experiment below deliberately does not depend on playback.

## Build

```bash
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme ADKLabHost -derivedDataPath build/dd build   # app + embedded dext
```

Unsigned by default (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED: NO`) — loadable only after one of
the signing lanes below.

### Lane A — ad-hoc, SIP-off bench (mrmidi's rig)

Requires SIP/AMFI relaxed + `systemextensionsctl developer on`.

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme ADKLabHost -derivedDataPath build/dd build \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=YES CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"
systemextensionsctl developer on   # allows running from the build directory
```

### Lane B — real DriverKit entitlements, SIP-on (Chris's machine)

Requires an Apple Development (or Developer ID) identity whose provisioning
profile carries `com.apple.developer.driverkit` +
`com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.audio`, with the bench machine's UDID in
the profile. The bundle ids must match what the profiles were issued for —
override them if they differ from the lab defaults:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme ADKLabHost -derivedDataPath build/dd build \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=YES \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development" DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<TEAMID> \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual \
  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER=<dext-profile-name-for-the-dext-target>
```

(Per-target overrides are easiest from Xcode's Signing pane after
`xcodegen generate`; with SIP on, the app must also be moved to
`/Applications` before activation.)

The dext entitlements file is `Driver/ADKVirtualAudioLab.entitlements`; the
host app's is `Host/ADKLabHost.entitlements` (system-extension install).

## Run

1. Launch `ADKLabHost.app`, click **Activate**, approve in System Settings →
   General → Login Items & Extensions.
2. Capture logs in a second terminal **before** starting audio:

   ```bash
   log stream --predicate 'sender CONTAINS "ADKVirtualAudioLab"' --style compact
   ```

3. The virtual devices ("ADK Config Lab — …", FireWire transport) appear in
   Audio MIDI Setup. Play audio at one of them if running the M3 playback
   experiment:

   ```bash
   # simplest: set it as output in Audio MIDI Setup, then
   afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff
   # or run minutes of pink noise from Music/Logic for a soak
   ```

4. Stop playback (coreaudiod stops IO a moment later), or switch default
   output away — `StopIO` fires and the `ADKLab[dump]` lines appear.
5. Deactivate from the app when done (or leave active for repeat runs —
   each StartIO resets counters).

## Configuration-change experiment (no playback required)

The **AudioDriverKit Configuration Transactions** panel in the host app is the
first focused experiment for the ADK request/perform/abort contract. It shows a
CoreAudio HAL snapshot, the per-device dext state, and the tail of the bounded
configuration event ring. Use the **44.1 kHz** and **48 kHz** buttons for any
slot while the device is idle; the panel issues a diagnostic user-client call,
not a playback request.

The expected driver-side sequence is:

```
HostRequest → RequestCalled → RequestReturned
             [host stops IO if necessary]
             → PerformEnter
             → DeviceRateMutation
             → OutputStreamMutation
             → InputStreamMutation
             → PerformMutation → PerformSuper → PerformReturn
             [host may restart IO]
```

An aborted host transaction records `AbortEnter → AbortSuper → AbortReturn`.
The current experiment changes only the nominal device rate and the matching
stream format selection. It intentionally does not reconfigure the simulated
FireWire packet engine for 44.1 kHz yet.

For the merged dext + host trace, start this before pressing a rate button:

```bash
log stream --info --debug --style compact \
  --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[ADKConfig]" OR eventMessage CONTAINS "[ADKConfigHost]"'
```

The same events are available through the panel's bounded ring, so a transient
transaction can still be inspected after the callback has returned. The host
mirrors newly observed ring events as `[ADKConfigHost]` to stderr as well, so
they are visible directly in Xcode's console.

The CLI is the authoritative smoke test because it compares three independent
views: the checked-in device model, CoreAudio HAL, and the live dext state.
It carries the diagnostic user-client entitlement and refuses to change a
device that CoreAudio reports as running.

```bash
CLI=build/dd/Build/Products/Debug/ADKLabCLI

$CLI adk status                 # topology/rate snapshot; nonzero on mismatch
$CLI adk events                 # read/mirror all bounded event rings
$CLI adk rate 2 44100           # one FW1814 transaction
$CLI adk smoke                  # all slots: alternate rate, then restore
```

`adk smoke` requires the full request/perform sequence plus device, output
stream, and input stream mutation events. Every parsed event is written to
stdout and mirrored as `[ADKConfigHost]` to stderr and unified logging, so the
same trace appears when the CLI scheme is run from Xcode. The dext-side detail
continues to use `[ADKConfig]` and includes each stream's before/after rate and
channel count.

## Reading the dump

```
ADKLab[dump] zts:      anchors, before_first_io, period, ring_frames, prepare_failures
ADKLab[dump] writeend: count, frames, min/max io size, sample_breaks, first_sample,
                       first_host_delta (ticks from StartIO seed), other_ops
ADKLab[dump] verifier: violations + the P1..P4 breakdown (Step 6 ids)
ADKLab[dump] packets:  published/data/nodata/acquire_failures
ADKLab[dump] payload:  visited/written/without_packet/outside_packet/raced_reuse
ADKLab[free] ...:      io_after_stop / timer_after_stop (O2, logged at teardown)
```

## Packet inspector (live dumps)

The host app embeds a packet inspector below the activation controls. **Dump**
(or ⌘D) snapshots the most recent N packets (8/16/32/64) from the running
dext — any time, including mid-stream. The capture is one `DispatchSync` onto
the dext work queue (~µs, serialized with the pump); the RT path is never
touched, so it is soak-safe.

Plumbing: `LabDiagUserClient` (connection type `'LDBG'`, selector 0) returns a
`PacketDumpBlob` (`Lab/PacketDumpBlob.hpp` is the layout contract, mirrored in
`Host/PacketDumpClient.swift`). The host app needs the
`com.apple.developer.driverkit.userclient-access` entitlement (already in
`ADKLabHost.entitlements`); on the SIP-on lane the provisioning profile must
carry it too.

Reading the inspector:
- Cadence strip: blue **D** = data, gray **N** = no-data, red **·** = evicted
  from the 512-deep ring (older than ~85 ms at 48 k).
- Detail pane: decoded CIP (sid/dbs/fn/qpc/sph/dbc, fmt/fdf/syt) plus the
  frames×channels slot grid — hex wire word and decoded raw-24 float per cell;
  zero slots are dimmed.
- "LIVE" on a record means the slot is still `ExposedForAudio`: the RT writer
  may land PCM into those bytes after the copy. Published/Completed records
  are frozen.
- The context line carries the capture-time cursors (zts sample time, exposed
  frames, writeEnd count) and the payload counters, so a dump is
  interpretable as a point on the stream timeline.

## Mapping counters → README questions

| Question | Where it lands |
|---|---|
| **C1** minimal IO trigger / anchors before first cycle | `zts: before_first_io`, `writeend: first_sample`, `first_host_delta` |
| **C2** ZTS tolerance (jitter/late/skip) | rerun with the timer chain perturbed; watch `sample_breaks` + audible glitches; flip `SetClockAlgorithm` Raw vs default |
| **C3** WriteEnd shape | `writeend: min/max`, `sample_breaks` (continuity), restart runs for sample-time reset behavior |
| **C4** period vs HAL buffer coupling | vary `kRingPeriods` / HAL IO size (Audio MIDI Setup), compare dumps |
| **O1** retain/teardown order | clean activate→deactivate cycles with no dext crash logs |
| **O2** callbacks after StopIO | `ADKLab[free] io_after_stop / timer_after_stop` |
| **O3** init-failure leak path | forced-failure experiment (edit init to fail after AddStream) |
| **M1 invariants under real pacing** | `verifier: violations == 0` over minutes of playback |

**Milestone 3 exit:** zero verifier violations over minutes of real HAL
pacing; the O/C answers recorded back into `README.md`; a captured WriteEnd
trace added to the host regression suite (trace extraction is the planned
follow-up — current dump carries aggregates + first-callback tuple).
